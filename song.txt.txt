SHE 
Sh.Aznavour

She may be the face I can't forget,
A trace of pleasure or regret,
May be my treasure or
The price I have to pay

She may be the song that summer sings,
May be the chill that autumn brings,
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day.

She may be the beauty or the beast,
May be the famine or the feast,
May turn each day into a
Heaven or a hell.

She may be the mirror of my dream,
A smile reflected in a stream,
She may not be what she may seem
Inside her shell.
